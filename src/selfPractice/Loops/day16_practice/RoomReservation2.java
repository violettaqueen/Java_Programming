Create a class called RoomReservation, write a program for the room reservation:
            King Bed ==> 120$
            Queen Bed ==> 100$
            single Bed ==> 80$
            the program asks the user which bedroom does he/she wants to reserve, and how many nights he/she is staying.
            Then Ask the user "would you like to reserve another room?""
                            if yes ==> repeat the entire steps
                            if no ==> return the  total price
                If user enters any invalid entry,  ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry
