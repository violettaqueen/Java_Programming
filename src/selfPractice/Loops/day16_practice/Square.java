 Write a program that can calculate the area and perimeter of a Square:
                        1. Ask the user "Enter the side of the square:"
                                if user enters 0 or negative numbers, terminate the program after displaying the error message
                                 "Invalid Entry for the side of the square"

                        2. Display:
                                        1. Area of square
                                        2. Perimeter of square

                        3. Ask the user "Would you like to calculate another Square?"
                                        If "yes" --> repeat the previous steps
                                        If "No" --> Print "Thank you for using Cydeo Square Calculator APP"

                                If user enters an invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry

                        Hint: you can use  System.exit(1) to terminate the entire program
