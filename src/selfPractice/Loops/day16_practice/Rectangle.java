 Write a program that can calculate the area and perimeter of a Rectangle:
                        1. Ask the user "Enter the length of the Rectangle:"
                                if user enters 0 or negative numbers, terminate the program after displaying the error message
                                 "Invalid Entry for the length of the rectangle"

                        2. Ask the user "Enter the width of the Rectangle:"
                                if user enters 0 or negative numbers, terminate the program after displaying the error message
                                 "Invalid Entry for the width of the rectangle"

                        3. Display:
                                        1. Area of rectangle
                                        2. Perimeter of rectangle

                        4. Ask the user "Would you like to calculate another Rectangle?"
                                        If "yes" --> repeat the previous steps
                                        If "No" --> Print "Thank you for using Cydeo Rectangle Calculator APP"

                                If user enters an invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry

                        Hint: you can use  System.exit(1) to terminate the entire program
